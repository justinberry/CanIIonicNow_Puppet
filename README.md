Install librarian-puppet library:

```
gem install librarian-puppet
```

Running
```
./setup.sh
```

Configuration

You can find basic configuration file here:
```
modules/my-android-config/manifests
```

If you have multiple projects you can probably make a new module for these projects. I'm new to puppet so we'll just have to see how this works out.
